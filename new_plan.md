# Bazel Sysroot C++ Hello World - New Plan

## Current Understanding

1. **What's Working**:
   - Bazel is successfully setting up the sandbox environment
   - The LLVM toolchain is being found and used
   - Clang is being executed (we can see it running)
   - The sysroot and include paths are being passed to the compiler
   - The sysroot structure is correct and contains all necessary C++ headers and libraries
   - We successfully got past the initial `iostream` include! ðŸŽ‰
   - We found and included the correct path for `c++config.h`! ðŸŽ‰
   - The `-nostdinc` approach fixed the C/C++ header order issues! ðŸŽ‰
   - Type definition errors for `size_t` are resolved! ðŸŽ‰
   - Found `stdarg.h` in the C++ tr1 directory! ðŸŽ‰
   - Updated to GCC 14.2.1 and using symlinks for GCC headers! ðŸŽ‰
   - Found all necessary C headers in the sysroot! ðŸŽ‰
   - Located `mbstate_t.h` and `__mbstate_t.h` in the sysroot! ðŸŽ‰

2. **What's Not Working**:
   - We seem to be in a loop with include path ordering:
     1. First we had `bits/c++config.h` not found
     2. Then we had fundamental type definitions missing
     3. Now we're back to wide character issues
   - The core issue appears to be that C++ headers are trying to use C functions from the global namespace
   - We need to maintain hermeticity by using only sysroot headers
   - The error is coming from `cwchar` trying to use `::mbstate_t` and other C functions
   - Platform configuration needs to be fixed to use the correct LLVM toolchain platform
   - We have duplicate compiler flags causing warnings and potential conflicts
   - The include paths are being added multiple times in different orders

## Fundamental Review

1. **The Program**:
   - `hello.cc` is a simple hello world program
   - It only includes `iostream`
   - It just prints a message and returns
   - This should be straightforward to build

2. **The Build Configuration**:
   - The BUILD file already has the necessary configuration:
     - `-nostdinc` and `-nostdinc++` to use our sysroot
     - Include paths for C++ and system headers
     - `--sysroot` pointing to our sysroot
     - `-stdlib=libstdc++` for the standard library
   - We're duplicating this in .bazelrc

3. **The Problem**:
   - We're trying to solve this at the wrong level
   - Instead of adding more complexity, we should simplify
   - We should focus on making the basic BUILD configuration work

## Attempts Made

1. **Custom cc_wrapper.sh**:
   - Created a wrapper script to set up environment and compiler flags
   - Issues: Script wasn't being used, Bazel still used its own wrapper

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - Tried setting PATH to include LLVM toolchain
   - Tried setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH for libraries
   - Issues: Variables weren't being expanded correctly in sandbox

3. **Compiler Flags**:
   - Added various include paths with `-I` and `-isystem`
   - Added `-nostdinc++` and `-nostdinc`
   - Issues: Flags might be in wrong order or conflicting

4. **Sysroot Configuration**:
   - Changed from `build --sysroot=...` to `build --copt=--sysroot=...`
   - This fixed the initial `iostream` include issue
   - Using absolute paths in environment variables
   - Using `-isystem` instead of `-I` for include paths
   - Added specific path for `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` headers

5. **C++ Mode Configuration**:
   - Tried using `-D__cplusplus` to force C++ mode
   - Issues: This didn't resolve the type definition issues
   - The C headers are still being processed before C++ headers

6. **Header Inclusion Order**:
   - Tried using `-include` to force `cstddef` to be included first
   - Issues: Still getting `size_t` errors in C headers
   - The C headers are still being processed before C++ headers
   - New error: `no member named 'max_align_t' in the global namespace`

7. **Complete Include Path Control**:
   - Used `-nostdinc` and `-nostdinc++` to disable default include paths
   - Added include paths in specific order:
     1. C standard headers first (GCC includes and base includes)
     2. C wide character headers second
     3. C++ headers third
     4. System headers last
   - Success: Fixed the C/C++ header order issues
   - New issue: Missing fundamental type definitions
   - Found `stdarg.h` in `usr/include/c++/tr1/` directory

8. **Standard Library Configuration**:
   - Identified conflicting `-stdlib` flags in .bazelrc
   - Found that MODULE.bazel explicitly configures `libstdc++`
   - Plan to update .bazelrc to use `libstdc++` consistently
   - This should resolve the `bits/c++config.h` not found error

9. **Include Path Order Revision**:
   - Discovered that C++ headers need to be included before C headers
   - Found that type traits and other C++ features need to be available first
   - Identified that wide character functions should be found in C++ headers first
   - New include path order:
     1. C++ headers first (main headers, then tr1)
     2. C standard headers second
     3. C wide character headers third
     4. System headers last

10. **Include Path Loop Analysis**:
    - Realized we're in a loop trying different include path orders
    - The core issue is that C++ headers need C functions from the global namespace
    - We need to maintain hermeticity by using only sysroot headers
    - We need to find a way to include C headers from the sysroot in a way that doesn't conflict with C++ headers

11. **Sysroot Header Analysis**:
    - Found all necessary C headers in the sysroot
    - Located `mbstate_t.h` and `__mbstate_t.h` in `/include/bits/types/`
    - Found C++ headers in `/include/c++/14.2.1.20250322/`
    - Verified the structure of the sysroot matches our expectations
    - Updated .bazelrc to include paths in the correct order:
      1. C++ headers first (including backward and tr1)
      2. C standard headers second (including bits and bits/types)
      3. System headers last

12. **Platform Configuration Fix**:
    - Fixed platform configuration in .bazelrc
    - Changed from `@platforms//cpu:x86_64` to `@toolchains_llvm//platforms:linux-x86_64`
    - This should resolve the "Target does not provide PlatformInfo" error

13. **Clang Command Analysis**:
    - Found multiple warnings about `-stdlib=libstdc++` in the output
    - These warnings might be from multiple compilation passes rather than duplicate flags
    - The actual compilation errors show a clear include path chain
    - We need to verify if the flags are actually being duplicated in a single compilation pass
    - The warnings might be a red herring - the real issue is still the missing C types

14. **Build Process Analysis**:
    - Bazel might be running multiple compilation passes
    - Each pass might generate its own warnings
    - We should focus on the actual compilation errors
    - The include path chain shows where the real problem is
    - The warnings about `-stdlib=libstdc++` might be unrelated to our core issue

## Observations

1. **Compiler Behavior**:
   - Clang is running but ignoring some flags
   - The `-stdlib` warnings suggest we need to fix our stdlib configuration
   - The include paths are now in the correct order
   - The sysroot path needs to be passed as a compiler option (`--copt=--sysroot=`) rather than a Bazel option
   - Using `-nostdinc` gives us complete control over include paths
   - We need to ensure all necessary C headers are included
   - Some C headers are located in the C++ tr1 directory
   - Wide character headers need to be included before C++ headers
   - C standard headers need to be included before any other headers
   - C++ headers need to be included before C headers to provide proper namespace definitions
   - C++ headers are trying to use C functions from the global namespace

2. **Sandbox Environment**:
   - The sandbox is properly isolated
   - Paths are relative to the sandbox root
   - Environment variables need special handling
   - Absolute paths work better than relative paths in the sandbox

3. **Sysroot Structure**:
   - The sysroot is correctly set up in `external/+_repo_rules+bazel_sysroot_library/`
   - Contains all necessary C++ headers in `usr/include/c++`
   - Contains required libraries in `usr/lib`
   - The structure matches a standard Linux sysroot layout
   - We need to verify the location of fundamental C headers
   - Some C headers are in the C++ tr1 directory
   - Wide character headers are in platform-specific directories
   - Fundamental type definitions are in GCC's include directories
   - Found `mbstate_t.h` and `__mbstate_t.h` in `/include/bits/types/`
   - All necessary headers are present in the sysroot

4. **Standard Library Configuration**:
   - MODULE.bazel explicitly configures `libstdc++` for all platforms
   - Current .bazelrc has conflicting `libc++` settings
   - Need to ensure consistent use of `libstdc++` throughout
   - This should help resolve the `bits/c++config.h` not found error

5. **Header Resolution**:
   - C++ headers must be found before C headers to provide proper namespace definitions
   - Type traits and other C++ features need to be available before they're used
   - Wide character functions should be found in C++ headers before falling back to C headers
   - The order of include paths is crucial for proper header resolution
   - C++ headers are trying to use C functions from the global namespace

6. **Compiler Command Analysis**:
    - The clang command shows all flags being passed
    - We can see exactly how Bazel is constructing the command
    - The order of flags matters for how they're processed
    - The warnings about `-stdlib=libstdc++` might be from multiple compilation passes
    - The include paths are being added in a way that might be causing confusion
    - We should focus on the actual compilation errors, not the warnings
    - The include path chain shows where the real problem is

## Next Steps

1. **Simplify Configuration**:
   - Remove duplicate flags from .bazelrc
   - Let the BUILD file handle the compiler flags
   - Focus on making the basic configuration work

2. **Verify Sysroot**:
   - Confirm the sysroot has all necessary headers
   - Verify the include paths in BUILD are correct
   - Make sure the sysroot path is correct

3. **Test Basic Build**:
   - Try building with just the BUILD configuration
   - Add flags to .bazelrc only if needed
   - Keep it simple

## Key Learnings

1. **Keep It Simple**:
   - Start with the basics
   - Add complexity only when needed
   - Don't overcomplicate simple things

2. **Configuration Levels**:
   - BUILD files are for target-specific configuration
   - .bazelrc is for global configuration
   - Don't duplicate configuration between them

3. **Debugging Approach**:
   - Start with the simplest possible configuration
   - Add complexity one step at a time
   - Verify each change

Let's simplify our approach and focus on making the basic BUILD configuration work.
